## Introduction
This project is the backend of Vidly, an imaginary video rental app.

This is the implementation of Vidly in Node.js.

## Setup

Make sure to follow all these steps exactly as explained below. Do not miss any steps or you won't be able to run this application.

### Install the Dependencies

Next, from the project folder, install the dependencies:

    npm i

### Start the Server

    node app.js

This will launch the Node server on port 3000. If that port is busy, you can set a different point in config/default.json.

Open up your browser and head over to: http://localhost:3000/api/genres

You should see the list of genres. That confirms that you have set up everything successfully.
